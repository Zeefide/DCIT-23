# DCIT 23 - Lab Activities and Exams

Welcome! This was made by Zeth Isaiah S. Mendoza from BSCS 1-A. This repository contains all the lab activities, midterm, and final projects I worked on for the DCIT 23 subject.


1. Lab 1
A simple console program that collects employee details like name, age, hours worked, and hourly wage. It then calculates and displays the employee’s daily wage.


2. Lab 2 
This builds on Lab 1 by adding more detailed wage calculations, like weekly, monthly, and yearly wages. It also shows how many years the employee has left until retirement and formats the name differently.


3. Lab 3
Here, I added checks for valid age and working hours, mapped job roles using a switch statement, and applied different tax calculations based on income. The program outputs a full employee summary with these
details.


5. Lab 4
This lab introduced a GUI version of the Employee Information System using Java AWT. It has input fields and displays results in a scrollable area. The program also handles input errors gracefully.


6. Lab 5
A simple quiz app made with Java AWT. It shows multiple-choice questions, tracks your score, and prevents changing answers after you finish. It also reminds you to select an answer if you try to move on
without one.


8. Lab 6
A To-Do List app built with Java Swing. You can add tasks with a name, description, and status. The tasks show up in a table, and the program makes sure you don’t leave required fields empty.


9. Midterms
A console-based IT Ticket System where you can add tickets with descriptions and urgency, update their status, view all tickets, and generate a report showing how many are pending or resolved.


10. Finals
A simple calculator GUI app using Java Swing. It supports basic math operations (+, -, *, /), has a clear button, and shows the current result or input. It handles division by zero by showing zero.
